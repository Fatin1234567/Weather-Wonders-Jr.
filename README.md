# Weather-Wonders-Jr.


## Aims 
The primary stakeholder - young children aim to gain knowledge of the world around them
(what to wear, safety tips, etc.) They want to go out and enjoy every aspect of their activity/
including playing outside with their friends.To gain knowledge through the application via fun
facts and clicking on “wear?” to show when it’s appropriate for them to go out in that weather
condition, slowly that would make them independent and understand about the weather,
which is made simple for kids to interact. For parents, their aim is for their children to
educate themselves and to enjoy themselves. Their success is measured by their kids being
able to think independently and make a good judgement based on the knowledge acquired.


## Sources of satisfaction
Children will be satisfied when they are able to interact with the application by learning about
the weather with little effort required. A simple interactive user interface with colorful images
is another source of satisfaction for the child. It will include features including learning about
fun facts and being able to play some mini-games within the app which will make the user
experience more fun which is important shown by our research.

## Knowledge and skills
Children start to gain a range of skills including problem-solving ability, can think of a simple
plan before acting, develop friends, play, be able to do things by themselves and
communicate more while also being at school. The knowledge involves being able to
understand and learn what temperature is and how it can correlate to the type of weather
and what to wear. Our weather app should be able to enhance and complement some of
these skills.


## Designing Process

Design that will be compatible with smartphones(ios and android). This is the ideal solution,
as the aim is to create a web app that is accessible to primary school children. Below, we
examine the direct benefits to our primary preschoolers as a result of this.

Weather applications would be accessible from any environment. Primary school children
tend to be curious and inclined towards understanding straight away. Therefore they will be
able to immediately accommodate their needs, this will allow our primary users to feel
acknowledged. Furthermore would leave them with a great experience every time resulting
in a contentment feeling and returning to It.

Understanding the minds of 6 to 10 years old children, we gained insight into children's
concentration level which is thought to be around 5 to 10 minutes. Thus, helps to retain
children's engagement as using a phone is seen as a small effortless task. This helps
children not to be put off creating a fun environment.

● The top-right icon(location) allows the primary stakeholder to easily acquire weather
information using GPS service

● The top-left helps the primary user to navigate to a landing page with one click

● Displaying the necessary information to stakeholders such as city, temperature,
visibility, and how it feels like

● The image of weather changes according to the temperature assisting primary
stakeholders the ability to visualise

● On-screen navigation help to identify the functionality of the app straightway

● This page is available once the fun fact button, which displays the key facts to the
primary stakeholder.

● The fun fact is based on the current temperature which gives important tips,
information, etc.

● The bottom is the image in the context of the fun fact.
Figure 3
● This page shows the temperature for upcoming days

● Image is provided next to the temperature to provide a way to visualise

● Option to suggest what to wear

Figure 4
● This page allows the primary stakeholders to understand what to wear

● Upon clicking it will show what to wear based on the temperature it was when clicked

● The primary stakeholder has the ability to change the scale using a circular button to
play around and also check for different temperature

Figure 5
● This page provides stakeholders interactive mini-game where they will drag the
image-based temperature provided in the graph

● Allows stakeholders to check results by clicking on submit button
